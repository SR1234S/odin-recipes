<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The best 20 minute dinner you'll ever make. Juicy chicken and buttery lemon sauce, what a combo!</p>

<h3>Ingrediants</h3>

<ul>
    <l1>2 large boneless skinless chicken breasts</l1>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
    <li>Flour for dredging</li>
    <li>Salt & pepper</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons lemon juice + zest of 1/2 lemon</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons butter divided</li>
    <li>Chopped fresh parsley optional, to taste</li>
</ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>

<ol>
    <li>Cut your chicken breasts in half lengthwise so you have thinner cutlets. Sprinkle them with salt, pepper, and garlic powder. Dredge them in flour so they’re nicely coated.</li>
    <li>Add the olive oil and 1 tablespoon of the butter to a skillet over medium-high heat. Once the pan is hot, add the chicken cutlets and cook them for 4-5 minutes/side or until they’re nice and golden. </li>
    <li>Add the chicken broth, lemon juice + zest, and remaining butter to the pan and let it bubble for a couple of minutes.</li>
    <li>Add the chicken back in and cook for another few minutes until it's cooked through and the sauce is further reduced. Season as needed</li>
